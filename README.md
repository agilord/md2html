# md2html

Yet another static site generator, which takes YAML config files, 
per-page frontend matter and markdown, and generates HTML pages using
mustache templates. 

## Why Another Static Site Generator?

It is easier to develop ~300 lines of code, than to figure out
ten times more how to plug the requirements into another framework.

## Setup

````
python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 /path/to/env
. /path/to/env/bin/activate
pip install markdown pystache pyyaml
````

## Usage
